New codes from US-Tur
"FC_SSITC_TEST", Results of the quality flagging for FC according to Foken et al 2004,
based on a combination of Steady State and Integral Turbulence Characteristics tests
by Foken and Wichura (1996) (i.e., 0, 1, 2)
same for FCH4_SSITC_TEST

Only data with quality 0 or 1 should be use (possibly not even 1)
