# Methane synthesis, examining the soil moisture and duration transition point from methane sink to source

Goal: consistent formatting of study site (lat/long), soil moisture as a percentage of potential water holding capacity (or similar),
duration of wet up (or time stamps for both flux and moisture), and methane flux

Bonus for soil temperature, texture, depth of soil in situ for incubations

## Overview

Created February 8th 2022 by Kendalynn A. Morris
Currently in an extremely preliminary and exploratory phase

### Get to know the data

###Currently three data sources

#Literature data
Original data were collected by Emily Kang from primary literature gathered by KAM,
Studies were found using search terms; “methane” and "soil moisture manipulation” OR “soil methane” and “precipitation manipulation” on Google Scholar in September 2021

#COSORE data
Seven datasets from COSORE (cloned September 7th 2021) contain methane and soil moisture data

#Ameriflux
15? upland sites have methane data
